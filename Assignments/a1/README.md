# CS3MI3 Assignment 1

This is a project skeleton for assignment 1 of CS3MI3. For a description of
the assignment, see the assignment section in avenue.

# Where do I write my code?

Please write the code for `evalExpr` in `src/A1/Eval.hs`, and your tests
in `test/Main.hs`. We have provided a pair of example `HUnit` tests for you; all
other tests should follow this pattern. Make sure to remove these two example tests before
submission!

# How do I compile, run, and test my code?

To compile your code, run `cabal build`. You can run GHCi with `cabal repl`; this
will automatically load `A1.Eval` for you! Tests can be run with `cabal test`.
